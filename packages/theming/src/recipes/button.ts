 * `ThemeablePropsRegistry` and `ThemeablePropsOf<"button">` widens the variants-only surface without

 *

 * (`loading`/`disabled` — defaulting these app-wide is a footgun); controlled/identity state; styling
 * channels, events, and raw DOM attributes. It also excludes **per-usage behavioral props**
 * (`nativeButton`/`type`): these describe *what a given button is* (an anchor styled as a button, a
 * submit button in a form), not a design-system-wide policy, so defaulting them app-wide is
 * meaningless — a preset that set `nativeButton: false` would break every plain `<button>` under it.
 *
 * Chrome content is a **factory** (`() => JSX.Element`), never a bare `JSX.Element`: a preset value
 * is one object shared by every instance, and a Solid `JSX.Element` is an already-built node that
 * would *move* if reused, so a factory (called per instance) is what keeps two simultaneously-loading
 * buttons from fighting over one loader node. Mirrors the `RenderProp` rule
 * (`@hope-ui/primitives/utils` render) and is resolved through `runIfFunction`.
