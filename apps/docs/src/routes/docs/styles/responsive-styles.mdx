# Responsive styles

An simple syntax to add mobile-first responsive styles.

## Usage

Hope UI allows you to use an _array or object_ syntax to add mobile-first responsive styles, this relies on breakpoints defined in the Hope UI theme.

The default breakpoints provided by Hope UI are listed below:

| Breakpoint | Value  |
| ---------- | ------ |
| `sm`       | 640px  |
| `md`       | 768px  |
| `lg`       | 1024px |
| `xl`       | 1280px |
| `2xl`      | 1536px |

<Callout>
  Hope UI use the `@media(min-width)` media query to ensure your interfaces are mobile-first.
</Callout>

### The array syntax

All style props accept arrays as values for mobile-first responsive styles.

For example to make the `width` of a `Box` responsive you can do:

```tsx
<Box bg="royalblue" width={[300, 400, 500]}>
  A responsive Box
</Box>
```

Based on the default breakpoints listed above, you can interpret this syntax like this:

- `300px` from `0px` and up.
- `400px` from `640px` and up.
- `500px` from `768px` and up.

<Callout>
  <span>To skip certain breakpoints, you can pass `null` to any position in the array.</span>
</Callout>

### The object syntax

The example above can also be written with an object syntax like this:

```tsx
<Box bg="royalblue" width={{ base: 300, sm: 400, md: 500 }}>
  A responsive Box
</Box>
```

Here each key represent a breakpoint defined in the Hope UI theme, while `base` define the base, non-responsive value.

<Callout>To skip certain breakpoints, just don't define them in the object.</Callout>

### Defining custom breakpoints

You can extend the default Hope UI theme to define custom breakpoints.

```tsx
import { extendTheme, HopeProvider } from "@hope-ui/core";

const theme = extendTheme({
  breakpoints: {
    sm: "320px",
    md: "768px",
    lg: "960px",
    xl: "1200px",
    "2xl": "1536px",
  },
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <HopeProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </HopeProvider>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to use the same unit for each value, the default theme use **pixel**.
</Callout>

## Demo

Below is a example of a card component that uses a stacked layout on small screens, and a side-by-side layout on larger screens **(resize your browser to see it in action)**.

<Preview isCentered>
  <ResponsiveCardExample />
</Preview>

```tsx
import { Box, Image, Flex, Text } from "@hope-ui/core";

function ResponsiveCard() {
  return (
    <Flex
      direction={{ base: "column", md: "row" }}
      border={({ vars }) => `1px solid ${vars.colors.neutral["200"]}`}
      rounded="lg"
      shadow="lg"
      w="full"
      maxW={{ base: 96, md: "none" }}
      bg="white"
      _dark={{
        borderColor: "neutral.800",
        bg: "neutral.900",
      }}

        maxW={{ md: 250 }}
