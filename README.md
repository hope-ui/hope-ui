Hope UI is a composable and accessible component library that gives you the foundation to build your next SolidJS application.

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Hope UI is in a rewrite process, focus will be on the next major version (`v1.0`) and no new feature will be added to `v0.x`.

Hope UI is **moving away** from CSS-in-JS and style props (Chakra UI like) API, if this is something important to you, consider switching to another solution. 

This project is not ready for production, use at your own risk.

## Why use Hope UI ?

- **Ready to go**: Start your project with over 40 well designed SolidJS components.
- **Composable**: Compose your UI with reusable building blocks.
- **Accessible**: Hope UI follows WAI-ARIA standards, helping you to reach the largest audience possible with less effort.
- **Themeable**: Use Hope UI's design system or customize it using the theming features.
- **Dark mode**: Add dark mode support to your app with just a few lines of code. All components are built with dark mode in mind.
